# Pardon_Me
A Multi-Persona GitHub Repo Insight Agent

## Problem
If you’ve ever opened a big GitHub repo and felt your brain immediately request sick leave… same. Repositories are these dense, messy ecosystems where everyone sees something different. A PM wants user flows, a QA wants to break things (lovingly), a designer wants a story, and a developer wants architecture—yet all we get is a glorified code dump and a silent prayer.

And expecting one person to magically extract all these perspectives from raw files? That’s borderline mythological.

So the actual problem sits here:
How do you translate a repo into role-specific understanding without sacrificing three days, eight coffees, and part of your sanity?

## Solution
This project grew out of that gap—a desire to make repositories a little less intimidating and a lot more readable.

I built a multi-persona insight engine that doesn’t just analyse a repo; it understands it the way different people need to understand it. The system uses parallel specialised agents to break the codebase into meaningful perspectives: user flow, technical architecture, edge cases, operational decisions. Each agent offers its own well-defined viewpoint, almost like a panel of experts studying the same story.

What makes it work is its ability to adapt. Once a user describes what they’re looking for, the system quietly infers their persona—PM, QA, Designer, Developer—and assembles a tailored summary that actually aligns with their goals. It gives every person the version of the repo that makes sense for them.

Most importantly, users can continue chatting with the agent after receiving the summary. They can ask follow-up questions, clarify confusing sections, or request deeper explanations—almost like having a knowledgeable teammate who already read the entire repo.
