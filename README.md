# Pardon_Me
A GitHub Repo Insight Agent

## Problem
Large GitHub repositories often read like dense technical forests—layers of code, scattered documentation, and enough jargon to overwhelm even experienced developers. The result is slow onboarding, unnecessary confusion, and a constant sense of “Where do I even start?”

## Solution
This project grew out of that gap—a desire to make repositories a little less intimidating and a lot more readable.

Pardon_Me is a focused multi-agent system that understands user intent, analyzes the repo via GitHub MCP, identifies jargon, and produces a clear, accessible interpretation. It turns sprawling codebases into structured, comprehensible insights without sacrificing rigor or precision, while still allowing users to engage with it conversationally. They can ask follow-up questions, clarify unclear sections, or dive deeper into specific components—much like consulting a well-informed teammate who already understands the entire repository.
